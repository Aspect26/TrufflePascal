/**
 * <p>
 * Each {@link Node} has one {@link TypeSystem} at its root to define the types that can be used
 * throughout the system. Multiple {@link TypeSystem}s are allowed, but they cannot be mixed inside
 * a single {@link Node} hierarchy. A {@link TypeSystem} optionally defines a list of types as its
 * child elements, in which every type precedes its super types. The latter condition ensures that
 * the most concrete type is found first when searching the list sequentially for the type of a
 * given generic value.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each {@link #value()} is represented as a Java type. A type can specify two annotations:
 * {@link TypeCheck} and {@link TypeCast}. The {@link TypeCheck} checks whether a given generic
 * value matches to the current type. The {@link TypeCast} casts a generic type value to the current
 * type. If the {@link TypeCheck} and {@link TypeCast} annotations are not declared in the
 * {@link TypeSystem} the a default implementation is provided. The default implementation of
 * {@link TypeCheck} returns <code>true</code> only on an exact type match and {@link TypeCast} is
 * only a cast to this type. Specified methods with {@link TypeCheck} and {@link TypeCast} may be
 * used to extend the definition of a type in the language. In our example, the
 * <code>isInteger</code> and <code>asInteger</code> methods are defined in a way so that they
 * accept also {@link Integer} values, implicitly converting them to {@link Double} . This example
 * points out how we express implicit type conversions.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Example:</b> The {@link TypeSystem} contains the types {@link Boolean}, {@link Integer}, and
 * {@link Double}. The type {@link Object} is always used implicitly as the generic type represent
 * all values.

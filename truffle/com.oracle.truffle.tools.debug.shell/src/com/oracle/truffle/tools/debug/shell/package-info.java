/**
 * This package contains <strong>REPL*</strong>: an experimental framework for
 * building a <em>language-agnostic</em> command-line oriented debugger that:
 * <ul>
 * <li>works with every Truffle-implemented language "out of the box",
 * i.e. requiring minimal additional support by language implementors;</li>
 * <li>works simultaneously, without special configuration, for all Truffle language implementations
 * available to it; and</li>
 * <li>demonstrates Truffle language-interopability by debugging seamlessly
 * across Truffle <em>cross-language</em> calls.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <h4>Goals for building <strong>REPL*</strong></h4>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Exercise and test <em>in action</em> the built-in
 * {@linkplain com.oracle.truffle.api.debug.Debugger} debugging support services
 * provided as part of the Truffle API, which in turn relies on Truffle
 * {@linkplain com.oracle.truffle.api.instrument.Instrumenter Instrumentation}.</li>
 * <li>Emulates a client/server architecture to demonstrate that
 * language-agnostic debugging can be implemented over wire protocols.  Wire
 * protocol communication between client and server is <em>partially</em> emulated
 * by passing messages expressed as textual key-value pairs. The emulation is
 * <em>partial</em> because both run interleaved on a single JVM thread, with some
 * sharing of resources.</li>
 * <li>Provide a working debugger that is always available during development
 * of new Truffle language implementations.</li>
 * <li>Provide a working debugger with extra support for Truffle language
 * development, in particular the ability to inspect the current structure
 * of the Truffle AST around a halted location.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <h4>Command Set</h4>
 * The Command Line Interface (CLI) for <strong>REPL*</strong> is based as
 * much as possible on the CLI for the
 * <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/documentation/">GDB Debugger.</a>
 * <h4>REPL* Functionality</h4>
 * Basic navigation:
 * <ul>
 * <li>StepIn (n times)</li>
 * <li>StepOut (n times)</li>
 * <li>StepOver (n times)</li>
 * </ul>
 * Execution:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Load a file source</li>
 * <li>Call a defined symbol</li>
 * </ul>
 * Stack:
 * <ul>
 * <li>List frames in current execution stack</li>
 * <li>Select a frame</li>
 * <li>Display selected frame contents</li>
 * <li>Move frame selection up/down</li>
 * </ul>
 * Evaluate:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Evaluate a Language string in halted context</li>
 * <li>Evaluate a Language string in selected frame</li>
 * </ul>
 * Breakpoints:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Set/create on a specified line</li>
 * <li>Set/create on any throw (before exception created)</li>
 * <li>Enable / Disable</li>
 * <li>One-shot (once only)</li>
 * <li>Get <em>Hit</em> count</li>
 * <li>Set <em>Ignore</em> count</li>
 * <li>Unset/dispose</li>
 * <li>Get all breakpoints</li>
 * <li>Find a breakpoint by UID</li>
 * <li>Set/clear the condition on a breakpoint</li>
 * </ul>
 * Others:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Display halted location in source</li>
 * <li>Nested execution
 * <li>Help</li>
 * <li>Info displays</li>
 * <li>Set/display options</li>
 * <li>Display Truffle AST structure</li>
 * </ul>

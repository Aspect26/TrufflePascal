/**
 * Domain specific language for using the Truffle dynamic object storage model to create classic
 * class hierarchies.
 * <p>
 * The dynamic object storage model ({@link com.oracle.truffle.api.object}) is well suited to
 * supporting dynamic object models such as those found in Ruby and JavaScript. This domain specific
 * language makes it easier to also use the object storage model when you know at the time you are
 * writing your language what properties you will need, you want to be able to specify that
 * declaratively, and you want to be able to access the properties of the objects efficiently
 * without creating many nodes to do that.
 * <p>
 * A typical use-case of the object storage model DSL is to implement language built-in classes
 * which need internal implementation properties, as well as dynamic properties set by the language
 * user. Using the object storage model DSL allows the object storage model to be conveniently used
 * for both of these with just the one {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.object.DynamicObject} instance,
 * while providing an interface that is similar to if you were defining normal Java fields in a
 * separate object.
 * <p>
 * The object storage model DSL is used by creating interfaces annotated with
 * {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.object.dsl.Layout}.
 *
 * @see com.oracle.truffle.api.object.dsl.Layout

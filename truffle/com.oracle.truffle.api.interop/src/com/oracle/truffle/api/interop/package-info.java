/**
 * This package provides inter-operability between different
 * {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.TruffleLanguage Truffle languages}.
 * <p>
 * Languages can exchange primitive Java type wrapper objects (e.g., 
 * {@link java.lang.Byte},
 * {@link java.lang.Short},
 * {@link java.lang.Integer},
 * {@link java.lang.Long},
 * {@link java.lang.Float},
 * {@link java.lang.Double},
 * {@link java.lang.Character},
 * {@link java.lang.Boolean},
 * and {@link java.lang.String}) 
 * as well as any type implementing 
 * {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.interop.TruffleObject}. Foreign objects are precisely those
 * implementing {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.interop.TruffleObject}.
 * <p>
 * To use a {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.interop.TruffleObject} from a different language, you need
 * to ask the language to build appropriate AST for a given
 * {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.interop.Message} with
 * {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.interop.Message#createNode}. The message can then be executed with
 * {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.interop.ForeignAccess#execute}.

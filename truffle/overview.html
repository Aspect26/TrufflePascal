Truffle is a framework for writing and executing interpreters. In case
you want to execute already written interpreters from your Java application,
start at {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.vm.PolyglotEngine}. In case you'd like
to write your own Truffle based language, start at 
{@link com.oracle.truffle.api.TruffleLanguage}.
<p>
To get the best speed out of your Truffle system, make sure you are running
on top of 
<a target="_blank" href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/graal/">Graal</a>
virtual machine.

<h4>Learning Truffle</h4>

<p>
Our typical sample language is called the <em>SimpleLanguage</em>.
A good entry point for exploring <em>SimpleLanguage</em> is the
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/graalvm/Truffle/blob/master/truffle/com.oracle.truffle.sl/src/com/oracle/truffle/sl/SLLanguage.java">SLLanguage</a>
class.
</p>

<p>
    There is an excellent tutorial <em>Add Graal JIT Compilation to Your JVM Language</em>
    written by Stefan Marr which gives real example of turning an existing language
    into <em>Truffle</em> based one:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Step 1:

    </li>
    <li>Step 2:

    </li>
    <li>Step 3: 
        <a target="golo" href="http://stefan-marr.de/2015/11/add-graal-jit-compilation-to-your-jvm-language-in-5-easy-steps-step-3/">Interpreting a Simple Fibonacci Function</a>
    </li>
    <li>Step 4: 
        <a target="golo" href="http://stefan-marr.de/2015/12/add-graal-jit-compilation-to-your-jvm-language-in-5-easy-steps-step-4/">Complete Support for Mandelbrot</a>
    </li>
    <li>Step 5: 
        <a target="golo" href="http://stefan-marr.de/2015/12/add-graal-jit-compilation-to-your-jvm-language-in-5-easy-steps-step-5/">Optimizing the Interpreter for Compilation</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The posts cover not only basics, and API usage, but also description
    of available tools for analyzing the performance and optimizing it.

<h4>Keeping Compatibility</h4>

<p>
The <b>Truffle</b> API values work of its adopters and as such it is developed
with compatibility in mind. Methods and features are not removed and renamed
randomly, without a notice and there is a binary compatibility testing framework
in place to verify that.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand the <b>Truffle</b> project is still young and needs a way
to refine and change previously taken decisions. To balance the need between
compatibility and give us a way to remove things from the API we following
these rules:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rather than removing/renaming or changing an API element (class, method,
        field), mark it <em>deprecated</em>.</li>
    <li>Make sure usage of such element can be replaced by non-deprecated ways</li>
    <li>Keep such element working until next release</li>
    <li>If possible provide automatic migration using Jackpot's META-INF/upgrade/ files</li>
    <li>When new (major) release is out, remove it</li>
</ul>
<p>
By deprecating parts of API while keeping them functional we are giving
users of the <b>Truffle</b> API time to adjust to required
changes and (under the assumption they pay attention to warnings in the code
base) easily identify and migrate to more modern API alternatives.

/**
 * The instrumentation API provides a way to introspect and inject behavior into interpreters
 * written using the Truffle framework.
 *
 * To adopt instrumentation support for a guest language implementation you need to annotate syntax
 * nodes of your language with {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.instrumentation.Instrumentable}. For
 * details please refer to {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.instrumentation.Instrumentable}.
 *
 * To use the instrumentation framework implementors must implement the
 * {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.instrumentation.TruffleInstrument} interface. Please refer to
 * {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.instrumentation.TruffleInstrument} for further details.
 *
 * Guest languages that want to use the capabilities of the instrumentation framework can access
 * {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.instrumentation.Instrumenter} for their
 * {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.TruffleLanguage language} by calling
 * {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.TruffleLanguage.Env#lookup lookup(Instrumenter.class)}.
 * {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.instrumentation.SourceSectionFilter Filters} created using guest
 * languages may be used to implement guest language features that require meta-programming
 * capabilities.
 *
 * Instrumentations can get enabled/disabled using PolyglotEngine.
 *
 * @see com.oracle.truffle.api.instrumentation.TruffleInstrument

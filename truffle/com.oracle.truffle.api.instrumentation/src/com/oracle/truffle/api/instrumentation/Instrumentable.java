/**
 * <p>
 * Marks a guest language AST node class as instrumentable which allows instrumentations to listen
 * to before and after execution events. An instrumentable node must provide a {@link SourceSection}
 * and a {@link #factory() wrapper factory} to create a wrapper for the instrumentable node. Wrapper
 * factories can be inherited by subclasses.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@link Instrumentable} nodes must extend {@link Node}. The instrumentation framework will, when
 * needed during execution, {@link Node#replace(Node) replace} the instrumentable node with a
 * {@link WrapperNode} and delegate to the original node. After the replacement of an instrumentable
 * node with a wrapper we refer to the original node as an instrumented node.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Wrappers can be generated automatically using an annotation processor. For that a class literal
 * named {WrappedNode}Wrapper must be used. If the referenced class was not found on the classpath
 * it will get generated. If the automatically generated wrapper factory and wrapper classes are not
 * suitable for the needs of the guest language then {@link InstrumentableFactory} can also be
 * implemented manually and referenced in {@link #factory()} using a class literal.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example for a minimal implementation of an {@link Instrumentable instrumentable} node with a
 * generated wrapper. For that at least one method starting with execute must be non-private and
 * non-final.
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#064;Instrumentable(factory = BaseNodeWrapper.class)
 * public abstract class BaseNode extends Node {
 *     public abstract Object execute(VirtualFrame frame);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * If the instrumentable node requires more than one parameter it the constructor it can either
 * provide a default constructor or it can also provide a copy constructor. For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#064;Instrumentable(factory = BaseNodeWrapper.class)
 * public abstract class BaseNode extends Node {
 *     private final String addtionalData;
 * 
 *     public BaseNode(String additonalData) {
 *         this.additionalData = additionalData;
 *     }
 * 
 *     public BaseNode(BaseNode delegate) {
 *         this.additionalData = delegate.additionalData;
 *     }
 * 
 *     public abstract Object execute(VirtualFrame frame);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see WrapperNode
 * @see ProbeNode
 * @since 0.12
